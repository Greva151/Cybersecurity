## Descritpion
Kirby has inhaled and spitted out the whole flag, but it's in pieces. Can you put it back together? P.S. Remember to wrap the flag in the usal format: 'ptm{}'

## Solution
Every charachter of the flag is scattered in all the frames. They contain numbers so it's easy to put it all together if we stop each frame.
