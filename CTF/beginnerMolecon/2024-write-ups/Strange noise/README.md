## Description

I heard a strange noise coming from this file. I think it's a message. Can you help me decipher it?

## Solution

1. Open the audio in Audacity.
2. View the spectrogram and notice that there is Morse code between the frequencies of 700 Hz and 900 Hz.
3. Use a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter to isolate the frequencies containing the Morse code.
4. Export the file containing the Morse code.
5. Use an online [decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) to extract the flag.
